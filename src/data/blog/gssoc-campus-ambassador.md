GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC) is one of India’s most impactful open source programs — and I had the chance to represent it as a **Campus Ambassador**.

## 🎯 Role & Responsibilities

As a Campus Ambassador, my goal was to:
- Spread awareness about open source
- Encourage students to participate in GSSoC 2025
- Help beginners understand Git, GitHub, and contribution flow
- Represent GSSoC values at my campus

## 💡 Initiatives I Led

- Hosted **intro sessions** on Git/GitHub basics
- Created a WhatsApp group for open source discussion
- Curated beginner-friendly issues for juniors
- Promoted GSSoC registration actively during the campaign window

## 🌟 Highlights

- Helped 50+ students make their **first pull request**
- Organized mock hackathons to simulate contribution flow
- Shared my personal contribution story to inspire others

## 👨‍💻 What I Learned

- Community leadership is as valuable as technical skill
- Clear communication is key when teaching Git workflows
- Students are eager — they just need direction and confidence

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Being a GSSoC Campus Ambassador wasn’t just about promotion — it was about empowering students to take their **first open source step**.
