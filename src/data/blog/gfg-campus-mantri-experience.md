In 2025, I was selected as a **GeeksforGeeks Campus Mantri** — an ambassador role focused on promoting coding culture, especially Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), among peers.

## 📣 What a Campus Mantri Does

- Promote GFG resources and contests
- Conduct workshops, quizzes, and bootcamps
- Share DSA challenges like 160 Days of DSA
- Help peers get started with coding

## 🎯 My Initiatives

- Organized weekly DSA practice sessions
- Created a Discord community for doubt-solving
- Promoted GeeksforGeeks events on campus channels
- Shared curated GFG articles & topic lists

## 💡 What I Learned

- Event planning & student engagement
- How to motivate peers without overwhelming them
- Importance of bite-sized, consistent practice in DSA

## 👥 Impact

- Helped over 100+ students start their DSA journey
- Guided juniors with resume prep and GFG job profiles
- Increased DSA awareness among non-CS branches too

## 🧠 Reflection

Being a GFG Campus Mantri wasn’t just a leadership badge — it was a responsibility to empower fellow students.

> “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together — with GFG.”

Highly recommend applying for this role if you enjoy coding *and* community-building.
