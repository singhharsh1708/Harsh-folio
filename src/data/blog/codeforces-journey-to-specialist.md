Iâ€™m thrilled to share a personal milestone â€” Iâ€™ve officially become a **Specialist** on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)! ðŸŽ‰

This achievement is not just about the color change but a reflection of consistent learning, practice, and growth in the world of competitive programming.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Regular **upsolving** helps build confidence with tougher problems.
- Focusing on **problem tags** like greedy, binary search, and prefix sums was crucial.
- Consistency is more important than intensity â€” even solving one problem a day adds up.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Next?

Now that Iâ€™ve entered the Specialist zone, Iâ€™m aiming for:

- **Expert** (1600+)
- Improving performance in early problems to save time for harder ones
- Mastering topics like **DP**, **Graphs**, and **Segment Trees**
