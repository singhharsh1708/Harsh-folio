Code for Bharat isn’t just another hackathon — it’s a movement to build digital public infrastructure (DPI) for India.  
Participating in **Season 2** was a game-changer for me.

## 🇮🇳 The Mission

Code for Bharat brings developers together to build:
- Open source solutions for public good
- Tools aligned with UPI, DigiLocker, and ONDC frameworks
- Accessible, scalable systems for Indian citizens

## 🛠️ My Project

I contributed to a web-based tool that:
- Simplified access to government schemes
- Offered multilingual support
- Used an intuitive dashboard for rural users

Tech stack included:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Firebase for backend
- Astro for front-end structure

## 👨‍💻 Teamwork & Learning

- Worked in a remote team with diverse backgrounds
- Attended mentor sessions with industry experts
- Pitched our idea to evaluators with a demo

## 🌱 What I Learned

- How to build for real India — not just metro users
- The importance of accessibility, simplicity, and mobile-first design
- Deep respect for community-driven tech

## 💡 Final Reflection

This wasn’t just about code. It was about solving problems that **actually matter**.
