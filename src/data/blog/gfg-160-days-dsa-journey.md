The **160 Days of DSA** challenge by GeeksforGeeks is more than just a roadmap — it’s a consistency engine.  
I took the challenge seriously and it massively improved my coding confidence.

## 🔁 The Challenge Format

- 📆 Duration: 160 Days
- 📌 Daily topics: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, DP, Graphs, etc.
- ✅ Solve 3–5 curated problems per day
- 🧠 Practice + theory + revision links included

## 🛠️ My Approach

- Allocated **2–3 hours every evening** for DSA
- Maintained a **GitHub repository** with solutions
- Used **GeeksforGeeks**, **LeetCode**, and **IDE tools** to test

## ✨ What I Gained

- 🔍 Deeper understanding of core topics
- ⚡ Faster problem-solving and time-bound discipline
- 📊 Higher accuracy and reduced fear of new problems

## 💥 Breakthrough Topics for Me

- Dynamic Programming (Tabulation over Memoization)
- Greedy Algorithms and edge case analysis
- Graphs: BFS, DFS, and cycle detection

## 🧠 Key Tips

- Don’t skip revisions — patterns matter
- Solve **hard problems on weak days** to build mindset
- Share your progress on LinkedIn or GitHub — public accountability helps

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This challenge reshaped how I approach coding. Not just with knowledge — but with habits.
