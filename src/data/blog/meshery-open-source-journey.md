My open source journey began when I discovered **Meshery**, a powerful cloud-native management plane by the Layer5 community.

## 🚀 Why Meshery?

Meshery isn’t just a DevOps project — it’s an ecosystem. It supports:
- Service mesh performance benchmarking
- Multi-mesh lifecycle management
- WASM-based policy evaluation

## 🧑‍💻 My Contributions

I contributed to:

- 🔧 Improving documentation for MeshSync and CLI features
- 🧪 Understanding and helping with **test coverage** improvements
- 🧱 Forking the repo and exploring `calculateRank.js` logic for GitHub stats

My favorite issues were:
- Improving `Meshery CLI` usability
- Exploring ideas for **kubectl plugins** with Kanvas snapshots

## 📚 What I Learned

- YAML, Helm, and Kubernetes configurations
- Git workflows (feature branching, PR reviews, rebase)
- Real-world team collaboration on a public repo

## ✨ Highlights

- Joined the community meetings
- Explored GSoC 2025 ideas related to:
  - MeshSync Snapshot plugin
  - WebAssembly policy evaluation with OPA

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Contributing to Meshery helped me bridge the gap between learning and **building for real users**.

> If you’re starting out in open source, look for projects like Meshery — welcoming, well-documented, and built for scale.

Stay tuned for more contributions, and maybe a GSoC badge soon! 😉
