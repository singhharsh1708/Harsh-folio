Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that promises to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers.

## 🧠 What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is based on the principles of **quantum mechanics**, a branch of physics dealing with the behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic levels.

## 🔁 Classical vs. Quantum

| Classical Computer | Quantum Computer |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Uses bits (0 or 1) | Uses qubits (0, 1, or both — superposition) |
| Sequential processing | Parallelism via entanglement and superposition |
| Deterministic | Probabilistic outcomes |

## 🔹 Qubits

Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computers. Unlike classical bits, qubits can be in a state of `0`, `1`, or **both simultaneously** — this is called **superposition**.

### Example:

A single qubit can be represented as:
