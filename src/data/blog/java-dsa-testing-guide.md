Writing good test cases is a critical part of mastering data structures and algorithms. In this guide, we will cover:

## ✅ Why Test Cases Matter

Many students ignore unit testing during DSA practice — but writing test cases ensures your logic works for:

- Edge cases
- Boundary conditions
- Performance on large inputs

## ✅ Sample: Reverse a Linked List

```java
@Test
public void testReverseLinkedList() {
    ListNode input = createList(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4});
    ListNode expected = createList(new int[]{4, 3, 2, 1});
    assertTrue(compareLists(expected, reverseList(input)));
}
